Building a tic-tac-toe web application using HTML,CSS and Javascript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, we can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these functionalities and technologies, users can play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
